  prompt I used:  collage made up of popular movie posters like Inception, Dune, La La Land, Parasite, Mad Max, and Blade Runner. The collage has a cinematic, moody tone with a purple-black color overlay, low brightness, and high contrast. Designed to be used as a full-page background with no text for a film-themed website.
